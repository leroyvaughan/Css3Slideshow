Css3 Slideshow (Phase 3)

With images, some CSS3 Decorations, and now some prev/next buttons, still gracefully degrades...

In Phase 3 I added the prev/next buttons and the associated code.  I would have done more, but 
this was just something I wanted to do for fun; and curiousity.  It is here, and should be pretty easy
to customize for most front end devs.  If not, there are always JQuery plugins
to choose from.
